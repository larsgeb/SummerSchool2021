    "# Installing a Custom Kernel\n",

    "A Jupyter notebook is attached to a **kernel**, which runs the code. A `Python 3` kernel is provided by default.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will **install a custom kernel** which loads a **conda environment** which has been created specifically for this course. It includes (amongst other things) `numba` (a JIT compiler for numerical functions in Python), `cupy` (numpy-like API for NVIDIA GPUs) and `TensorFlow`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab looks for user-installed kernels in `$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/`, so this is where we will install it. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> This week we will mostly be using the kernel we are about to install (ss2021). So if you find that you can't import tensorflow, for example, please check you are using the kernel ss2021 (check the top right of the workspace, or the extreme bottom left).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will install our new kernel by issuing commands directly from this notebook. The most important file in a kernel directory is `kernel.json`. This is a JSON serialised dictionary containing the following keys and values (and some optional others):\n",
    "- `argv`: list of command line arguments used to start the kernel. The text `{connection_file}` in any argument will be replaced with the path to the connection file (this specifies how to set up communications with the frontend).\n",
    "- `display_name`: The kernel’s name in the user interface. \n",
